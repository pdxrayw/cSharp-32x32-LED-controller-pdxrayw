look into enum casting to int and possibly sending an int or char only over
the serial channel odd number ons work evens do not but for switch statements
it may not even matter

May need to read in all data and put it into a string or something by
concatonating or mabey just something + next read. not sure.

Above works
For Sketch 
Next write functions that read in the serial data and check switch statement for which 
signal to adjust.
May still need to do some minor error checking on the text field, for strange behavior?.

for c# application
issues are Some have been resolved need to check
entering 0 
entering 0 and backspace
entering 0 and space bar
All letters
Entering 00 or double zero

Also need to combine parts of firstLEDcontrol and LEDcontrolFromSimpleDashboard

digitalWrite(r0, LOW); 
digitalWrite(g0, LOW); 
digitalWrite(b0, LOW); 
digitalWrite(r1, LOW); 
digitalWrite(g1, LOW); 
digitalWrite(b1, LOW); 
digitalWrite(A, LOW); 
digitalWrite(B, LOW); 
digitalWrite(C, LOW); 
digitalWrite(D, LOW); 
digitalWrite(stb, LOW); 
digitalWrite(clk, LOW); 
digitalWrite(OE, HIGH);

Do I even need a switch statement? can I just send the correct value
to a function to turn on the right pin and return a "strSignal"
or even an intSignal to the function??

hmmmmThinking.....how to do that??? .........
